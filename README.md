Personal Config Files
Jon Lasser <jon@lasser.org>

This is a set of files that Jon uses to customize his environments,
packaged with a handy installation script. The script should back up any
files it's preparing to overwrite, but of course caution is urged with
any such system automation.

#Instructions
* Run *./install* or *bash ./install* from this directory, if bash is
  not in /bin/bash.
* If wanting to run other than against your home directory, prefix that
  command with *PREFIX=/new/location*, e.g., *PREFIX=/other/dir
  ./install*

#Contents
* bash\_profile: $HOME/.bash\_profile
* bashrc: $HOME/.bashrc
* nethackrc: $HOME/.nethackrc
* sshconfig: $HOME/.ssh/config
* vimrc: $HOME/.vimrc

##Mac Only contents
* DefaultKeyBinding.dict: $HOME/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict
* \*.terminal: Drag and drop into OS X Terminal

#To Do
* I'm sure I'll think of something
