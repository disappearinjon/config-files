#Instructions
* Hard-link the files desired to their target locations. DO NOT
  soft-link, as the installed copies will go away if the directory is
  deleted, and you don't want that.
* Install other files from here as recommended:
** Merriwether Sans font: https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/merriweather-sans

#Contents
* bashrc: $HOME/.bashrc
* nethackrc: $HOME/.nethackrc
* sshconfig: $HOME/.ssh/config
* vimrc: $HOME/.vimrc
* \*.terminal: Drag and drop into OS X Terminal

#To Do
* Makefile to hard-link files automagically
* Update vimrc to use newer package manager than Pathogen
